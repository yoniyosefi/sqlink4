Time is a human construct, and you were below the waves
Time after time, July was in her eyes
But if you lie, you lie to your soul
Your soul let it fly
I remember the rainy days in Chinatown
Oh, I hope you'll be okay
Time after time, July was in her eyes
But if you lie, you lie to your soul
All we're offering is a chance to be loved

You are a sun Goddess
Will you save me?
Hooray for you.
Hooray.
Now the rain it comes, the rain it blurs the grey line
...the grey line...the Greyhound home
You are so vicious (Hurt me, I can take it)
Cause it's all in the heat of the moment,
It's all in the pain
Sonar, sonar again...
It's on again, (got no wings...gossamer wings...) ...on again...
You are a sun Goddess!!!
Will you save me? ...babe...babe...babe...
Cause it's all in the heat of the moment
It's all in the pain!!!
So give in to the heat of the moment
Give in to the pain!!!
