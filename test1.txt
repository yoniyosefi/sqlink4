Time is a human construct, and you were below the waves
Time after time, July was in her eyes
But if you lie, you lie to your soul
Your soul let it fly
I remember the rainy days in Chinatown
Oh, I hope you'll be okay
Time after time, July was in her eyes
But if you lie, you lie to your soul
All we're offering is a chance to be loved
