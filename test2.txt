Falling down endless shaft
Submission giving way at last
Feeling suddenly brave
Grace is all that is left

[Bridge]
Is there any chance of recreation
Of what I used to feel?
Is there any chance of recreation
Of what I used to feel?

[Chorus]
Wire around my sanity
Fire is the only force inside me
Wire applying pressure on me
Fire, only feeling left inside me

Wire around my sanity
Fire is the only force inside me
Wire applying pressure on me
Fire, only feeling left inside me

Wire (wire) around my sanity
Fire (fire) is the only force inside me
Wire (wire) applying pressure on me
Fire (fire), only feeling left inside me
