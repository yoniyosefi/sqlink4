Falling down endless shaft
Submission giving way at last
Feeling suddenly brave
Grace is all that is left

[Bridge]
Is there any chance of recreation
Of what I used to feel?
Is there any chance of recreation
Of what I used to feel?

[Chorus]
Wire around my sanity
Fire is the only force inside me
Wire applying pressure on me
Fire, only feeling left inside me

Wire around my sanity
Fire is the only force inside me
Wire applying pressure on me
Fire, only feeling left inside me

Wire (wire) around my sanity
Fire (fire) is the only force inside me
Wire (wire) applying pressure on me
Fire (fire), only feeling left inside me

Daft notions of pitfalls
A shaft built of distrust
Getting rid of the infancy
What used to be the remedy
Where have I gone?
What still remains?
Pitfalls
I've been around for all these years
I hear the sound of distant bells
And I've been around for all these years
I'm on the ground yet again
I've been around
What still remains?
Where have I gone?
The craft of living
The art of forgiving
The art of forgiving
Where have I gone?
What still remains?
Where have I gone?
What still remains?
The start of a new world
The fresh leaves uncurl
The shed has been torn down
My bed is no longer a safe zone
No longer a safe zone
And I've been around for all these years
And I hear the sound of distant bells
And I've been around for all these years
And I fell to the ground yet again
